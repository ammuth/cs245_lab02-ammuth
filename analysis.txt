Lab 01

Running Time: Lab01 runs in n time or O(n) = Linear time

Reasoning: We have 5 lines of code being executed exactly once. We also have 2 sets of 2 lines of code (for loop)
executed n+1 times and 3 lines of code (for loop) executed n+1 times. Thus, we have 3 for loops (3n) but we can
simplify this to O(n).

Space: The space that is required for Lab01 is O(n) and is linear as well.

Reasoning: We need to see how many constant terms we have. We can spot these at lines 6,10,16, and 24.
On line 6 we are doing a declaration plus 1 so this will be n+1. Then we have 4 for loop declarations which
will give us n+1+4 = n+5. So we have O(n+5) and since we can drop the 5 we have O(n).
